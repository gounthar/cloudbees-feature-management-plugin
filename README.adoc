# CloudBees Feature Management Jenkins Plugin

## Introduction

A simple Jenkins Plugin to support CI/CD automation of some CloudBees Feature Management operations.

[IMPORTANT]
==== 
This plugin repository may eventually move to https://github.com/jenkinsci
====

## Installing the plugin

The plugin needs to be installed manually. The latest `.hpi` plugin file can be download from the latest run of the link:https://github.com/rollout/cloudbees-feature-management-plugin/actions/workflows/upload-hpi.yaml?query=branch%3Amaster[Upload Plugin HPI Workflow]. After downloading, unzip the file to get the `.hpi` file to install in Jenkins.

[IMPORTANT]
==== 
It is not recommended to share this plugin outside of CloudBees *while this repo is NOT managed properly* (under CAP/link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/[jenkinsci]) and therefore not published from an official Update Site from where users can automatically receive updates.

While the plugin is in an unofficial repo (like this) it will miss important updates (e.g. security updates) and therefore *may compromise a Customer's installation* if installed there.
